Hello! I am Adriano Valadar and I am a Software Developer. 

My main languages are C and C++. I also know Java and Python and I am interested in learning Rust in a near future.

I have a MSc degree in Electrical Engineering.

In my freetime I like to exercise, to learn new things, to read, to be with my family and friends, to be at the beach and, of course, to code!

If you have an idea and want to see if Iâ€™d be interested in helping out, don't hesitate to contact me.
