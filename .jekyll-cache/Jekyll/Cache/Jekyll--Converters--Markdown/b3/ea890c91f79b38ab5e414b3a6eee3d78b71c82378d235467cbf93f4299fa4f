I"ÿ<p>Hello! I am Adriano Valadar and I am a Software Developer.</p>

<p>My main languages are C and C++. I also know Java and Python and I am interested in learning Rust in a near future.</p>

<p>I have a MSc degree in Electrical Engineering.</p>

<p>In my freetime I like to exercise, to learn new things, to read, to be with my family and friends, to be at the beach and, of course, to code!</p>

<p>If you have an idea and want to see if Iâ€™d be interested in helping out, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me.</p>
